This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# We can perform an exploration of our model 
# through the use of the summary function as shown
# ---
# Upon running the code, the function would give us information about the model 
# i.e. the size of rules, depending on the items that contain these rules. 
# In our above case, most rules have 3 and 4 items though some rules do have upto 6. 
# More statistical information such as support, lift and confidence is also provided.

Interpretation of rule 3: If a customer buys mushroom cream sauce and pasta, he/she is more likely to buy escalope with a confidence level of 95%

```{r}
# Ordering these rules by a criteria such as the level of confidence
# then looking at the first five rules.
# We can also use different criteria such as: (by = "lift" or by = "support")
# 
rules<-sort(rules, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)
inspect(rules[1:7])
```

Interpretation: The first four rules have a confidence level of 100%
